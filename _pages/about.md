We concieved of Topophilia over drinks with friends. In particular, after listening to us banter back and forth in our own conversation for 15 minutes, a friend of ours (likely out of frustration!) suggested "Hey, guys––why don't you make a podcast so you can always listen to yourselves talk." So, we did. 

This is a podcast about places, the people who care for them, and the things we love to do in them. We realized that as the current state of public lands, recreation, resource extraction, and politics continues to get more complex and the consequences more significant, we had a desire to dig into these issues and share our ideas as well as the ideas of others. We hope that by doing so, we will not only further our own knowledge, but we will inspire you, our listeners, to think more deeply and engage more confidently in the ownership and use of the landscapes around you. Lastly, we want to recognize that we are not journalists, and that we will certainly experience some growing pains and might even run into some uncomfortable truths while attempting to shed some light on different issues. Despite that, we are greatly looking forward to sharing our thoughts with you and hope that you will do the same with us
