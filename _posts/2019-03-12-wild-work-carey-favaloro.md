Welcome to the first installment in our new series Wild Work, which highlights individuals who, motivated by their connections to place, are devoting time and resources to create something amazing. These folks are passionate, driven, and inspired to do their work by the places that they choose to surround themselves with. They are athletes, fishermen, scientists, activists, and more. What unites them is their sense of commitment to a cause which is rooted in their communities, livelihoods, and the places they call home.

Our first conversation is with Carey Favaloro, an Aspen Mountain Ski Patroller, educator, and badass mountain athlete, among many other things. We called up Carey to discuss an inspiring and important project that she’s working on. Carey is racing the Grand Traverse, a 40-mile ski race from Crested Butte to Aspen, Colorado, through the rugged elk mountains. Along the way she’s raising money for the Wilder Women Project, a Colorado non-profit that creates opportunities for women to spend time in wild places together. So far Carey and her partner Sammy Podhurst have raised over $5,000 and counting. During the race Sammy and Carey will have to rely closely on each other to assess avalanche problems, make route-finding decisions, and pick each other up when they are feeling down. As Carey explains, the race is a perfect example of why it’s so important for women to get outside together to learn more about themselves and the spaces they find themselves in. We hope you enjoy listening.
