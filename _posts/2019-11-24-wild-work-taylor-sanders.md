Taylor Sanders, together with her partner Ryan, practices regenerative agriculture on a small farm ([Long Table Farmstead](https://www.longtablefarmstead.com/)) on the front range of the Colorado mountains. A former vegan intent on changing the way our food is raised, Taylor's path took a radical turn when she took a butchery apprenticeship in Italy and returned with a new view on the role of livestock in our food system. When the call came to take over a small plot of land in Lyons, Colorado, she and her partner Ryan knew they couldnâ€™t pass it up. This episode is chock full of stories of global change at a local level, building trust and connection in a new community, and how being open to new opportunities can lead you in unexpected directions.
