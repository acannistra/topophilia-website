                <a href="https://alisonmillerarch.com/about/"><b>Alison Miller</b></a>: I lived in tidewater Virginia, northern Arizona, the Willamette Valley (Bachelor of Architecture, minor in Historic Preservation, University of Oregon ’08), and in Grand Teton and Yosemite National Parks before settling in Leavenworth in 2013. My move to Leavenworth was primarily inspired by rock climbing, but I decided to stay for the people.  After four educational and enjoyable years of working at a local architecture firm, I set off on my own in search of a flexible lifestyle in which I can still serve the community. As an architect, I love learning about each client’s unique needs and desires and figuring out how to make that a reality. I also strive to bring more sustainable design and building methods into my work, considering how each project can have a positive impact on the community as a whole. When I’m not busy architecting, I spend time with friends and family, work on being a community activist, and enjoy many of the amazing outdoor opportunities right out my back door, especially rock climbing, trail running, and skiing. My dog likes skiing the best.
