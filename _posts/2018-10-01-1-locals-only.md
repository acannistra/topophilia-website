What does it mean to be a "local" somewhere? For us, local status is deeply connected to intimate knowledge of a place --- the best secret camping spots, the cheapest happy hour, leftover powder stashes, and empty saturday morning trails. In this episode we look into how we define locals, and along the way we confront some of our own preconceptions. We speak with three people---Alison Miller of Leavenworth, WA; Matt Lanning of Aspen, CO, and Gabe Joseph of Santa Fe, NM---who help us along this journey. It turns out that local identity is a little more nuanced than we imagined.
