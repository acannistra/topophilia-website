## Topophilia <small>is a podcast about place, made by Tony Cannistra and Will Russack.</small>


This is a podcast about places, the people who care for them, and the things we love to do in them. We realized that as the current state of public lands, recreation, resource extraction, and politics continues to get more complex and the consequences more significant, we had a desire to dig into these issues and share our ideas as well as the ideas of others.

We hope that by doing so, we will not only further our own knowledge, but we will inspire you, our listeners, to think more deeply and engage more confidently in the ownership and use of the landscapes around you.
